# Tortilla Soup

## Ingredients 

* 6 **corn tortillas**, preferably a little old and dried out
* 1/4 cup **peanut oil**
* 1/2 cup small **onion**, chopped
* 2 cloves **garlic**, finely chopped
* 1 **jalapeño** chile, seeded, veins removed, chopped
* 4 cups **chicken broth**
* 1 can **diced tomatoes**, undrained
* 1/2 teaspoon **coarse salt**
* 1 1/2 cups shredded cooked **chicken**
* 1 **avocado**
* 1/2 cup shredded **Monterey Jack cheese**
* Chopped fresh **cilantro**
* 1 **lime**, cut into wedges

## Instructions 
1. If you are starting with somewhat old, dried out tortillas, great. If not and you are starting with relatively fresh tortillas, put them on a baking sheet and put them in the oven at 200°F for 10-15 minutes to dry them out a bit. It is best to start with tortillas that don't have a lot of moisture in them. Cut tortillas in half; cut halves into 1/4-inch strips. In 3-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Fry strips in oil, 1/3 at a time, until light brown and crisp. Remove from pan; drain on paper towels. Reserve.
2. Heat oil remaining in saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook onion in oil 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add garlic and chile; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in broth, tomatoes and salt. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 15 minutes. Add chicken; heat until hot.
3. To serve, peel and pit the avocado. Cut into 1-inch slices. Divide half of tortilla strips among 4 individual serving bowls; ladle in soup. Top with avocado and cheese; garnish with remaining tortilla strips and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
